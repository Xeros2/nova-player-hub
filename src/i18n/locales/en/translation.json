      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I use Nova+ on multiple devices?",

      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What if my device ID changes?",
        "answer": "If you reset your device or reinstall the app, a new Device ID may be generated. Contact support with your previous activation details for assistance."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "How can I become a reseller?",
        "answer": "Visit our 'Become a Reseller' page to learn about our reseller program. You'll get access to a special panel to manage customer activations and earn commissions."
      },
      "q11": {
